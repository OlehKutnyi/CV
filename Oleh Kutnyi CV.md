## 📄Summary

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub here you can find my resume and projects. Currently, I’m a third-year student at Kyiv School of Economics(KSE). Apart from economics, my studying in university was mainly connected to math and working with data. I had courses like Statistics & Probability, Regression Analysis, Econometrics, Data Preparation and Visualisation on R, etc. I am also a fan of the scientific data-driven approach in life and business; that's why I want to begin my career as a data analyst. Unfortunately, I don’t have any real working experience in the field, however, I’ve done several projects at university and created a simple project in SQL & Tableau to show some of my skills. I also have experience working with Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn), but unfortunately, currently I don't have a good project to show.
